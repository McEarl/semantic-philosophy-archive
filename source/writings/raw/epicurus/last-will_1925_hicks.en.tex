\noindent On this wise I give and bequeath all my property to \sn{Amynomachus}, son of \sn{Philocrates of Bate} and \sn{Timocrates}, son of \sn{Demetrius of Potamus}, to each severally according to the items of the deed of gift laid up in the \sr{Metroon of Athens}{Metron}, on condition that they shall place the garden and all that pertains to it at the disposal of \sn{Hermarchus}, son of \sr{Agemarchus of Mytilene}{Agemortus, of Mitylene}, and the members of his society, and those whom \sn{Hermarchus} may leave as his successors, to live and study in.
And I entrust to my School in perpetuity the task of aiding \sn{Amynomachus} and \sn{Timocrates} and their heirs to preserve to the best of their power the common life in the garden in whatever way is best, and that these also (the heirs of the trustees) may help to maintain the garden in the same way as those to whom our successors in the School may bequeath it.
And let \sn{Amynomachus} and \sn{Timocrates} permit \sn{Hermarchus} and his fellow-members to live in the house in \sn{Melite} for the lifetime of \sn{Hermarchus}.

And from the revenues made over by me to \sn{Amynomachus} and \sn{Timocrates} let them to the best of their power in consultation with \sn{Hermarchus} make separate provision
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\arabic*)}]
  \item for the funeral offerings to my father, mother, and brothers, and
  \item for the customary celebration of my birthday on the tenth day of \sn{Gamelion} in each year, and for the meeting of all my School held every month on the twentieth day to commemorate \sr{Metrodorus of Lampsacus}{Metrodorus} and myself according to the rules now in force.
\end{enumerate*}
Let them also join in celebrating the day in \sn{Poseideon} which commemorates my brothers, and likewise the day in \sn{Metageitnion} which commemorates \sr{Polyaenus of Lampsacus}{Polyaenus}, as I have done hitherto.

And let \sn{Amynomachus} and \sn{Timocrates} take care of \sn{epicurus-son-of-metrodorus?Epicurus}, the son of \sr{Metrodorus of Lampsacus}{Metrodorus}, and of the son of \sr{Polyaenus of Lampsacus}{Polyaenus}, so long as they study and live with \sn{Hermarchus}.
Let them likewise provide for the maintenance of \sr{Metrodorus of Lampsacus}{Metrodorus}'s daughter, so long as she is well-ordered and obedient to \sn{Hermarchus}; and, when she comes of age, give her in marriage to a husband selected by \sn{Hermarchus} from among the members of the School; and out of the revenues accruing to me let \sn{Amynomachus} and \sn{Timocrates} in consultation with \sn{Hermarchus} give to them as much as they think proper for their maintenance year by year.

Let them make \sn{Hermarchus} trustee of the funds along with themselves, in order that everything may be done in concert with him, who has grown old with me in philosophy and is left at the head of the School.
And when the girl comes of age, let \sn{Amynomachus} and \sn{Timocrates} pay her dowry, taking from the property as much as circumstances allow, subject to the approval of \sn{Hermarchus}.
Let them provide for \sn{Nicanor} as I have hitherto done, so that none of those members of the school who have rendered service to me in private life and have shown me kindness in every way and have chosen to grow old with me in the School should, so far as my means go, lack the necessaries of life.

All my books to be given to \sn{Hermarchus}.

And if anything should happen to \sn{Hermarchus} before the children of \sr{Metrodorus of Lampsacus}{Metrodorus} grow up, \sn{Amynomachus} and \sn{Timocrates} shall give from the funds bequeathed by me, so far as possible, enough for their several needs, as long as they are well ordered.
And let them provide for the rest according to my arrangements; that everything may be carried out, so far as it lies in their power.
Of my slaves I manumit \sn{Mys}, \sn{Nicias}, \sn{Lycon}, and I also give \sn{Phaedrium} her liberty.
